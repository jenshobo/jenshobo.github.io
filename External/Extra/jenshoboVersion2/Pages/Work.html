                        Frantic fling is a mobile game I made as a prove of concept. 
                        The set of goals I had for this game is that it needed to be:<br>
                        A) endless (that is, in theory).<br>
                        B) not relying on graphics, so it only should consist of simple shapes.<br>
                        C) have ads, even if you hate them, I still wanted to make use of them.<br>
                        <br>
                        The end result, after some brainstorming, is Frantic fling. 
                        It is a game where you can fling the ball up the level, while avoiding obstacles. 
                        While your flinging the ball up, rising lava is always catching up to you, so you have to outrun it. 
                        Meanwhile you'll also find green orb's, picking these up can allow you to get new skin colors in the shop.

                        For my MBO study at Friese poort in Drachten I was expected to do an internship. 
                        This however was easier said than done due to the then ongoing pandemic. 
                        Anyway I still managed to get a job at Brin in Groningen, 
                        where I would work on a VR game for the Oculus Quest 2.
                        This game is being made in Unity with C#, this was right up my alley. 
                        It was my job then to build a multiple of interactive game objects, these range from simple to make to difficult.
                        Some of the items I build include: <br>
                        items that move when you get to close, <br>
                        items that change when your in a specific area, <br>
                        items that change the environment and items that have dynamic insides that you can find and view. <br>
                        <br>
                        These items are anything from geometric shapes, posters to a town in the distance. 
                        All the items I made had in common that they are items that can interact with the player.
                        One item in particular was quite the challenge to program as it involved the mesh (basically the geometric shape of an object) to be split triangle by triangle. 
                        The end result ended up working as wanted, by the next sprint this item was done.

                    <a id="Link" href="./Work/DuckHunt.html">
                        During my internship at Brin I started a number of side projects, 
                        most of them I dropped later on as these where too big to create by a single person. 
                        However, one project I started I did finish, that being Duck hunt (1987) remade for the Oculus Quest in Unity (C#).
                        For the game I used assets made by other people to get the used sprites, models, UI, sound and music. 
                        All the code which makes the game playable of course was written by me. 
                        Without the code there would be no game, then it would just be a weird collection of random sounds and pictures.
                        <br><br>
                        What made this project quite fun was picking apart the old game on NES, 
                        as I own this game in my collection this made it easy to pickup and figuring out how the game works. 
                        I would then go on to recreate what I found in C# and test it on my VR headset. To see what does and what doesn't work.
                        After the main gameplay elements from the original where implemented I was able to make it look good with trees, grass and a good UI.

                    <a id="Link" href="./Work/Site.html">
                        I made this site from scratch using only HTML and CSS. 
                        This site is being hosted on GitHub using GitHub Pages. 
                        This only allows static websites, so websites that are run completely on the end-users computer, 
                        nothing is run on the server besides fetching and sending the site data. 
                        (aka HTML and CSS). Otherwise I would make use of PHP as well.
                        <br><br>
                        The thing that made this site difficult to make is that I have no experiences working in HTML and CSS. 
                        All you see here is build while learning about the language. 
                        This is also why you won't see anything special in this site. It is all quite basic.
                        <br><br>
                        My reason for going with a slightly worse looking site over using a program like Wix is because Wix allows a site to be made using no programming. 
                        This does not look good on my, and as my portfolio, 
                        if you are into the programming community you know a person using Wix or any other program like it can be seen as lazy. 
                        For this reason I made the decision to remake the whole website myself and host it on GitHub.
                        <br><br>
                        If you were to visit my old portfolio site you will be greeted with a popup saying we moved to here.

                        A game I made for the Commodore 64, it is completely written in the BASIC programming language. 
                        This is a project I started in between school projects. It was made in about 2 days which includes learning the language again.<br>
                        About the game itself:<br>
                        In the game your spaceship moves down, on your way are obstacles that you will need to dodge. 
                        You can if you wish destroy these obstacles, doing so will grand you points, 
                        but the game will progress even if you don't. If you destroy these obstacles they will explode, 
                        so these you still need to avoid. As you go down you will pick up speed until a certain point where you will be shown your current score. 
                        After pressing the fire button you go on to level 2 where you will find more obstacles and the game repeats. This goes on until you hit one of the obstacles.
                        <br><br>
                        The game was made quite a while ago now, which is a shame as I lost the program file now. 
                        Due to this the only things I have from it are the video and a single photo.
