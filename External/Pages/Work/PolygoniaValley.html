          <h2>PolygoniaValley</h2>
          <b>For my MBO (level 4) studie game development I was tasked with getting an internship.
            Due to the then ongoing pandamic, this was easier said than<br>done.
            However, despide this, I still landed a job at Brin. At that point they where making an educational game for the Oculus Quest 2.
            <br><br>
            Because of the pandamic I ended up working mostly from home. We ended<br>up needing to set a lot of rules for the development of the project.
            These<br>rules where from my understanding always respected.

            For Brin I was tasked with developing nummerous gameobjects.
            These objects all had to be educational in some way.
            I was tasked with making items based on mathmathics and space. As these are the themes I knew a decent amount of.
            <br><br>
            The objects usually had some sort of interaction with the player. Usually when entering an area.
            After which the object state would change and the visuals of the object would change as well.
            <br><br>
            Some of these objects gave an interesting challange, ones given to me.
            One object in particular needed to be taken apart on every face of the object (every flat surface of the object).
            For this I made a script that would disassemble the whole mesh. Furthermore the script was made to be as modular as possible.
            Where any mesh could be used and the script wouldn't need to be changed.

            Regardless, I am proud of the work I provided for Brin and look forward to<br>see the game release.
            Whenever that may be.

            For more information I suggest going to the site of Brin:
