          <h2>Websites</h2>
          <b>
            When it comes to programming related items, websites are an odd branch<br>for me.
            As I usually keep myself to the functional languages like C++ or Java.
            But for my MBO studie I was required to make a portfolio website.
            Back then<br>I had no knownage on html, css or JavaScript, as a matter of fact, I still don't really know a lot about them.
            <br><br>
            Regardless I made one using Wix. This I now regard as version 0, continue reading on this site for the next versions.

                My first self made website took the Wix site as insperation, but instead was completely programmed by myself.
                The biggest reason for this was because of an inside joke at my collage where Wix is frown upon because we are studying for a software engineering position.
                <br><br>
                It helped that I recently came across a way to host websites for free, as I am not willing to pay for hosting a website that get's barely any visitors.
                The deal only was that the site cannot be dynamic. This meaning the html all needed to be written by hand.
                <br><br>
                While this isn't that dificult, it is a lot of work.

                From this point on I really tried to put a lot of programming standard into the html by using classes and id's.
                By doing this I also managed to add a number of animations to the site. However I believe I ended up going a bit overboard with this.
                The end result of this was a decent looking site (again, I am not a designer. To me it looks good) but it might be difficult to navigate.
                <br><br>
                This version of my site was the shortest lived one before I wanted to create something new.

                This is the most recent site, version 3. This takes what I have learned form the previous 2 and makes, in my opinion, a good looking and easy to navigate website.
                <br><br>
                with this version I kept the animations to a minimal, only having some in buttons and page transitions, something I wanted to add to the previous sites but didn't knew how.
                Instead I added a lot of image effects. the biggest of being the blurred background on all pages. Which makes every page feel a lot better.
