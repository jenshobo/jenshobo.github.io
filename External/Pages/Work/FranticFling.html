          <b>
            Frantic Fling is a prove on concept game, the idea was to create a traditional mobile game
            with, and I know it sounds bad but, ads.
            <br><br>
            The Idea was to keep the game simple.
            Something that doesn't require outstanding graphics, but is instead made out of simple shapes.
            This felt<br>more at home for me as I have barely if any skills in the art side of making games.
            I just keep to the programming.
            <br><br>
            The game was created in a short time. As at that point I also still worked at Brin and couldn't just do as I pleased.

                The goal of the game is to fling your ball up as high as you can,
                while<br>avoiding randomly generated obstacles.
                During this you'll also need to keep moving up as a rising lava is contantly trying to catch up with you.
                <br><br>
                During the game some extra challanges precent itself. These are in the<br>form of green coins apearing.
                Collecting enough of these allow you to buy new skins for your ball. Usually just some other colors, but the most expencive one is a rainbow.
                Another challange added to the game was the addition of extra obstacles the further you go.
                For example, after a while the walls on the left and right of the screen become lava as wel.
                This is of course told to the player via waring labels.
