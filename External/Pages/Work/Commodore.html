          <h2>Commdore</h2>
          <b>
            For a small sideproject of mine I wanted to go back to the programming language that introduced me into the field.
            This being the language BASIC. For this I desided to create a game for the Commodore 64C. The game itself was based of text characters rather than dedicated graphics,
            this was mostly due to the speed of BASIC and to keep the project as simple as possible.
            <br><br>
            The goal of the game is to shoot down as many stars as possible. while avoiding them as well.
            When you shoot a star it goes supernova and thus still needs to be avoided. The game ends when you get hit.
            So it is a score based game and while it is really simple, compared to what I wrote before on the same computer. It was a masive improvement.
            <br><br>
            While I would like to continue on the project, I unfortunately lost the program, as saving to tape leaves a lot to be desired.
            Maybe for a next time I'll try looking into 6502 assembly, but with how assembly languages are structured this isn't something I'll do anytime soon.
