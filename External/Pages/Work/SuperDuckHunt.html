          <h2>Super DuckHunt</h2>
          <b>
            Duck Hunt is one of my favorite NES games. So when I got a VR headset I thought the game would work really well on the system.
            Of course a form of duckhunt already exists on VR, this being the game Duck Season.
            However that game ends up being more of a horror game, which isn't really my thing.
            So the only other option I thought would work was just to create my own version.
            <br><br>
            The game was created in Unity for the Oculus Quest 2, because of this an external computer is not needed.
            The game plays almost presicely like the<br>old NES game but with a 3D inviourment. With the only sprites from the old games returning being from the dog, ducks and UI.

                All other assets are from the Unity asset store. However I made sure to not import any external code, only using my own.
                <br><br>
                Lastly I had plans to make the game multiplayer as well. And while I have another project as a prove on concept on Unity multiplayer. I don't think I ever finished that part of Super DuckHunt.
                <br><br>
                I have created a gameplay video of the game, but keep in mind that it is a video of an old build, so it might have some bugs.
