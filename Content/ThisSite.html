                I made this site from scratch using only HTML and CSS.
                This site is being hosted on GitHub using GitHub Pages.
                This only allows static websites, so websites that are run completely on the end-users computer, nothing is run on the server besides fetching and sending the site data. (aka HTML and CSS).
                Otherwise I would make use of PHP as well.
                <br><br>
                The thing that made this site difficult to make is that I have no experiences working in HTML and CSS. All you see here is build while learning about the language.
                This is also why you won't see anything special in this site. It is all quite basic.
                <br><br>
                My reason for going with a slightly worse looking site over using a program like Wix is because Wix allows a site to be made using no programming.
                This does not look good on my, and as my portfolio, if you are into the programming community you know a person using Wix or any other program like it can be seen as lazy.
                For this reason I made the decision to remake the whole website myself and host it on GitHub.
                <br><br>
                If you were to visit my old portfolio site you will be greeted with a popup saying we moved to here.
