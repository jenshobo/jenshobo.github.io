# A bit about me

In a not so formal way...

## Who am I?

I'm a 24 (as of 2025) year old student at Windesheim in Zwolle. Most of my enjoyment with this study comes from the programming related challenges that come out of it. These are then obviously also my best performing areas, that and the practical assignments. The languages I ended up enjoying the most are low level ones, low as in close to hardware, not as in easy, because it's not. Anyway, so I usually end up programming in C/C++, which also has been my chosen language for advent of code for a while now. Besides that I do know my way around some other languages like Java, C# and Python. Not so much JavaScript (example: see this whole site).

## My hobbies

In general my hobbies include electronics. I have a keen eye for vintage electronics and enjoy tinkering with them. My room is filled with old stuff. Besides that I do enjoy playing a game or two when I can, my library is bigger than I can ever hope to play in my live, so I think I'm good in that area. And besides, I usually settle for a good movie or tv-show instead, as long as the ratings are good I'll probably enjoy it.

## How I work

I have quite the difference between quality in my work when it comes to company/study work and personal, at the study I have been called the 'programming nazi' (their words, not mine) because I tend to demand a high standard in styling of code. Sure, I'll make the occasional spelling mistake but it has a high priority for me. When I'm working on a personal project... not so much. Not that that matter much anyway. I generally almost immediately make a [git guide](https://github.com/jenshobo/jenshobo.github.io/blob/main/Extra%20Content/gitguide.md) and [style guide](https://github.com/jenshobo/jenshobo.github.io/blob/main/Extra%20Content/styleguide.md) (these where used for a Python project) for professional projects I'm working on, while these are not as extensive as some of the ones you can find online, they ensure I can properly manage the team and the quality of the code.
