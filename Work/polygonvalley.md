# Polygon Valley

For my internship, which I followed for my MBO lvl 4 Game Development studie I ended up getting a job at Brin (doesn't seem to exist anymore now, sad). For this internship we where tasked to continue work on a game the company had been working on for a little while longer at that point. This was an educational game for the [Oculus Quest 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_2), though we mostly developed with the [Quest 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Quest) in mind, since Brin wanted to have the compatibility with older hardware.

## Working hours

With this internship came a number of odd things, for one it was at the height of the [corona pandamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), which ment I spend a lot of hours working from home. During my almost full schoolyear of working there I only worked 3 full days at the office, only 1 of which I managed to see my boss, but by this point I was already wrapping up the internship in order to start with my final exam for MBO, which i aced. One particular thing I ended up doing while at this internship, which I still look back to is that I completely forgot I had 2 workweeks worth of manditory vacation time. I got in the rythem and it took a final exam notice to bring me out of it again.

## My work for them

My work for Brin ended up consisting out of a number of game assets they could use wherever they would seem fit. The work essentially broke down to me asking what my boss wanted to add to the game, realising this and then presenting it. Repeat this for about a year. My work for them mostly consisted out of ```C#``` code, since we used the [Unity engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)). But I did work with the game artist students whenever this was needed. This was mostly for creating meshes and materials, something I am not able to do on their level or at their speed.

## The results

With me having to do my final exams for my MBO studie, the internship quickly came at a close. I ended up being happy with the results that I managed to deliver after only having learned programming for about 2.5 year at that point. My boss ended up being happy with the results as well and a few years after the internship ended while I already started my HBO studie I ended up giving them a call, which they seemed happy with. My work was still used in the project at that point and some of my old MBO colleges where happily continuing on my work. Later however I ended up noticing Brin's site was no longer online, I don't know if the project is still active, I don't even know if the company still exist. But regardless, I learned a lot and I do not regret working there.

p.s. if I ended up working there again, then I would change their methode of working now that I have learned more at a HBO level. Not to call their working methodes bad, but rather, subpar...
