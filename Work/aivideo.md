# AI

AI has been a relevant topic in the world for a little while now, due to this I only see it just to voice my opinion on the matter. This page is also made for a video I made at the same time, which you can find below (ones it is done rendering and uploaded).

## Lazy programmers

As the saying among programmers goes "a lazy programmer is a good programmer", pretty much all programmers I personally know are rather lazy (this doesn't have to apply to everyone). The result for this was that A lot of code ends up being copied and pasted from other places, most notably from a site like [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions). However this came with a risk, the fact that what you copy you don't understand. To mitigate this for myself, whenever I ended up going to stack overflow I ended up looking at their implementation and writing my own based on that info, maybe it doesn't work the first try but at least I knew precisely what that code does and I could apply the code to my own standards.

The end result of this ended up being that while I aced a lot of programming assignments that the school gave me, a lot of students that would just copy and paste the code simply didn't. *pat's myself on the scholder*.

## Enter AI

Seemingly out of nowhere, AI chatbots started to appear everywhere and before I could realise it, everyone was using them. The benefit of AI being that you can ask it very specific questions and get an answer in seconds, while if you where to search the answer yourself on Google, it could take multiple minutes, if you'll find it at all. The downside of this however is that now even trivial things gets copied and pasted from AI. The result of this being that the programmer hasn't got a clue on what the code does. If a bug where to present itself in the code the programmer would have no idea where the issue would be coming from and ends up being completely reliant on the use of AI for that code.

## A proper use case

What I believe to be a good use of AI is to first realise what it is, a super intensive program that takes a but load of electricity to run and water to cool. So please do keep simple questions away from it as this is just a waste of resources. Then when you want to use AI to create a program I advise mostly sticking to small implementation where you as the programmer have all the freedom to change it up as you please. Please do try to understand everything you copy and paste into your code, preferably don't copy and paste anything, rather write your own implementation based on what AI says.

## An improper use case

What you absolutely shouldn't do with AI is make it write whole scripts for you without you realizing what it does. This makes the code messy and thus unmaintainable. Don't let AI write your documentation, while it may be used as a spell checker, it's writing your whole documentation will only result in the same problem as before.

## Finally

Most importantly of all, don't think your boss will fire you to replace you with AI, your boss most likely wouldn't know tooth from nail when it comes to doing it himself.
