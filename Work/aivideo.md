# AI

AI has been a relevant topic in the world for a little while now. Due to this, I only share my opinion on the matter. Music and sound effects sourced from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). The LEGO models and animation are made in [mecabricks](https://www.mecabricks.com/) and [blender](https://www.blender.org/) by me. While I have used blender before for simple video editing, this is the first time I have used the software for 3D animation.

# Lazy Programmers

As the saying among programmers goes, "A lazy programmer is a good programmer." Pretty much all programmers I personally know are rather lazy (this doesn't have to apply to everyone). The result of this is that a lot of code ends up being copied and pasted from other sources, most notably from a site like Stack Overflow. However, this comes with a risk, the fact that what you copy, you might not understand. To mitigate this, whenever I visit Stack Overflow, I look at their implementation and write my own version based on that information. Maybe it doesn't work on the first try, but at least I know precisely what that code does and can adapt it to my standards.

The end result of this approach is that, while I aced many programming assignments given by my school, many students who simply copy and paste the code did not. *Pat myself on the shoulder.*

# Enter AI

Seemingly out of nowhere, AI chatbots started to appear everywhere, and before I knew it, everyone was using them. The benefit of AI is that you can ask it very specific questions and receive an answer in seconds. If you were to search for the answer yourself on Google, it could take several minutes, or you might not find it at all. The downside, however, is that even trivial things are now copied and pasted from AI. The result of this is that the programmer often has no idea what the code does. If a bug were to appear in the code, the programmer might not know where the issue is coming from and could become entirely reliant on AI for that code.

# A Proper Use Case

I believe a good use of AI is to recognize what it is: a super-intensive program that consumes a lot of electricity to run and water to cool. Therefore, avoid asking it simple questions, as this is just a waste of resources. When you want to use AI to create a program, I recommend sticking to small implementations where you, as the programmer, have full freedom to modify the code as you see fit. Always try to understand everything you copy and paste into your code. Preferably, don't copy and paste at all, write your own implementation based on what AI suggests.

# An Improper Use Case

You should absolutely avoid making AI write entire scripts for you without understanding what it does. This leads to messy, unmaintainable code. Don't let AI write your documentation either; while it can be used as a spell checker, relying on it to produce your entire documentation will only lead to the same problems as before.

# Finally

Most importantly, don't think your boss will fire you and replace you with AI. Your boss most likely wouldn't know a tooth from a nail when it comes to doing it themselves.
