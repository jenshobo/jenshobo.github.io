# The assignment

For the last school project for my forth year, and probably my last project before my final internship, we where tasked with realising two events for a [Unitree G1 EDU](https://www.unitree.com/g1). We where tasked by our school with creating a presentation for [Windesheim Community of Practice for Generative AI](https://www.windesheim.ai/cop/) using the humanoid robot as the centerpoint, while we where also tasked by the company [Breman Innovation (aka Breinn)](https://breinn.nl/) to enable the robot to walk up the Aple d'Huez in France.

## Research

During the start of this project we wouldn't be getting the robot until around halfway through the project. Due to this we started with researching what was possible, for this we ended up trying our hands on creating an AI model for the robot. For this we tried both reinforcement learning as wel al imitation learning, this way we could fall back to one or the other, even in the worst case we could advice Breman on how to approach this software. All this research was shared with Breman to the best of our ability at the time (even though our teacher thought otherwise).

## Realising

For realising the project we first wanted to tackel the simpelest one as a stepping stone to the harder one, so we first created a Siri like system to be run on the robot which would include special commmands like start, stop, sit, wave, handschake, etc. We made the software modular to allow for more commands to be easily added. However due to a lack of time we did not fully realise the second task, this being the walk up on Aple d'Huez. While the robot did walk up, what we were working on simply wasn't yet ready at the deadline. This being a following system using the build in cameras on the robot.

## Media attention

For this project we ended up getting a lot fo attention from the media, the being the company Breman and our school itself internally, as wel as [RTL oost](https://www.oost.nl/nieuws/3521651/meest-geavanceerde-robot-van-europa-zet-eerste-stapjes-in-zwolle), [NOS](https://nos.nl/regio/overijssel/artikel/634958-meest-geavanceerde-robot-van-europa-zet-eerste-stapjes-in-zwolle) and [de Stentor](https://www.destentor.nl/zwolle/zwolse-robot-wil-bekende-franse-berg-beklimmen-maar-zakt-in-elkaar~a88be6e4f/)
