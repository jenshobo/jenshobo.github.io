        For my MBO study at Friese poort in Drachten I was expected to do an internship.
        This however was easier said than done due to the then ongoing pandemic.
        Anyway I still managed to get a job at Brin in Groningen, where I would work on a VR game for the Oculus Quest 2.
        <br><br>
        This game is being made in Unity with C#, this was right up my alley.
        It was my job then to build a multiple of interactive game objects, these range from simple to make to difficult.
        <br><br>
        Some of the items I build include: items that move when you get to close, items that change when your in a specific area,
        items that change the environment and items that have dynamic insides that you can find and view.
        These items are anything from geometric shapes, posters to a town in the distance.
        All the items I made had in common that they are items that can interact with the player.
        <br><br>
        One item in particular was quite the challenge to program as it involved the mesh (basically the geometric shape of an object) to be split triangle by triangle.
        The end result ended up working as wanted, by the next sprint this item was done.

        At the end of my internship I got a passing grade from my then teacher,
        my boss was (and judging by his resent word choice this is) quite impressed with the work I and others delivered,
        saying that he gave us quite difficult tasks to handle.
        In the last week there I ended up not doing a lot of work in the game but rather documenting what I had built for the student taking my place and giving tips here and there.
        If it wasn't for the fact I needed to go back to school to do my exams I would easily see myself work there for an actual job.
